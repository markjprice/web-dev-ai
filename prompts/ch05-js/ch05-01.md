> **Prmompt**: Show me three of the most common JavaScript memes as images on Reddit.

JavaScript is a frequent subject of humor on Reddit, particularly in communities like r/ProgrammerHumor. Three of the most common themes for these memes include:

1. **Type Coercion and Equality:** Memes often highlight the confusing results of JavaScript's loose equality (`==`) and addition, such as `[] + []` resulting in an empty string or `'5' - 1` equaling `4` while `'5' + 1` equals `'51'`.
2. **The "JavaScript: The Good Parts" vs. "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" Comparison:** A classic visual meme comparing the thinness of a book containing only the "good parts" of the language against the massive size of the complete documentation.
3. **Framework Fatigue:** Jokes about the incredible speed at which new JavaScript frameworks (like React, Vue, Svelte, or Next.js) are created, often suggesting that a new "industry standard" appears every time a developer takes a nap.
