> **Prompt**: Please summarize all the conditional and loop statements in JavaScript and include code examples for each one.

JavaScript uses conditional statements to perform different actions based on different conditions and loops to repeat a block of code.

---

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements control the flow of execution based on truthy or falsy values.

### 1. `if`, `else if`, and `else`

The standard way to branch logic. It evaluates a condition in parentheses and executes the block if the result is `true`.

```javascript
let temp = 25;

if (temp > 30) {
  console.log("It's hot outside.");
} else if (temp > 20) {
  console.log("The weather is nice.");
} else {
  console.log("It's a bit chilly.");
}

```

### 2. `switch`

The `switch` statement is a more organized way to compare the same expression against multiple possible values (cases). It uses strict equality (`===`).

```javascript
let fruit = "Apple";

switch (fruit) {
  case "Banana":
    console.log("Yellow fruit.");
    break;
  case "Apple":
    console.log("Red or green fruit."); // This will execute
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown fruit.");
}

```

### 3. Ternary Operator (`? :`)

A shorthand for an `if...else` statement, often used for simple assignments.

```javascript
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(status); // "Adult"

```

## Loop Statements

Loops allow you to run the same code multiple times, usually until a specific condition is met.

### 1. `for` Loop

The most common loop. It consists of three optional expressions: initialization, condition, and final expression.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration number: " + i);
}

```

### 2. `while` Loop

Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `true`.

```javascript
let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
  console.log("Count is: " + count);
  count++;
}

```

### 3. `do...while` Loop

Similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the block of code **at least once** before checking if the condition is true.

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log("This runs once even if i is 0");
  i++;
} while (i < 0);

```

### 4. `for...in` Loop

Used to iterate over the **enumerable properties** (keys) of an object.

```javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

for (let key in user) {
  console.log(key + ": " + user[key]);
}

```

### 5. `for...of` Loop

Used to iterate over **iterable objects** like Arrays, Strings, or Maps. It returns the values themselves rather than the keys.

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}

```

To gain full control over how your code branches and loops, you can use **Jump Statements**. These keywords allow you to exit a loop early or skip specific parts of it based on a condition.

---

## 1. The `break` Statement

The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop it is currently inside. It "breaks" out of the loop and moves the execution to the next line of code following the loop block.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Stops the loop entirely when i reaches 5
  }
  console.log(i); // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}

```

## 2. The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement doesn't stop the whole loop. Instead, it "skips" the rest of the code inside the current iteration and jumps directly to the next iteration (re-evaluating the loop condition).

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue; // Skips the rest of the block when i is 2
  }
  console.log(i); // Outputs 0, 1, 3, 4
}

```

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | `break` | `continue` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Action** | Exits the loop completely. | Skips the current iteration. |
| **Next Step** | Moves to the code *after* the loop. | Moves to the *next* cycle of the loop. |
| **Common Use** | Stopping a search once a result is found. | Skipping "invalid" data or specific values. |

### Pro-Tip: Labeled Statements

In JavaScript, you can actually "label" a loop. This is useful if you have nested loops and want to `break` or `continue` an outer loop from inside an inner one.

```javascript
outerLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (i === 1 && j === 1) {
      break outerLoop; // Exits both loops entirely
    }
    console.log(`i=${i}, j=${j}`);
  }
}

```
