> **Prompt**: Please generate a JavaScript snippet with errors for me to debug.

Here is a JavaScript snippet that contains **three logical and syntax errors**. This script is intended to filter a list of numbers and calculate their average, but it currently won't run or produce the correct result.

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];

function calculateHighAverage(nums) {
  let total = 0;
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i <= nums.length; i++) {
    const currentNum = nums[i];

    // We only want to average numbers greater than 25
    if (currentNum > 25) {
      total += currentNum;
      count++
    } else (currentNum < 10) {
      console.log("Very small number detected");
    }
  }

  const average = Total / count;
  return average;
}

console.log("The average is: " + calculateHighAverage(numbers));

```

### Your Challenge:

1. **Find the Loop Error:** There is a common "off-by-one" error in the `for` loop declaration.
2. **Find the Syntax Error:** Look closely at the `else` block logic.
3. **Find the Reference Error:** Check the variable naming inside the average calculation.

Would you like me to give you a hint for one of them, or should I provide the corrected version with an explanation of the fixes?
