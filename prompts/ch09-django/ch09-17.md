> **Prompt**: What are the limits of the Django admin, and when should you stop using it and build custom views?

The Django Admin is one of the framework's most seductive features because it provides a "free" interface for your data. However, the official documentation itself warns that the admin's primary purpose is for **internal management**, not as a user-facing application.

Knowing when to leave the admin behind is the hallmark of a senior Django developer.

## 1. The Hard Limits of the Admin

While the admin is highly customizable, it eventually hits a "complexity wall" where you are fighting against the framework rather than working with it.

### A. Non-Model Centric Workflows

The admin is built around the **Database Table**. If your task doesn't map directly to a single model (e.g., a dashboard that pulls data from three different APIs, calculates a complex risk score, and displays a D3.js chart), the admin will struggle.

### B. Complex Permissions

The admin's permission system is "all-or-nothing" at the model level (e.g., a user can either change *all* Posts or *no* Posts). If you need row-level logic (e.g., "Users can only edit Posts they created"), you have to override several obscure methods like `get_queryset` and `has_change_permission`.

### C. Branding and User Experience (UX)

The admin is designed for utility, not beauty. If you need a specific mobile-first layout, a custom multi-step wizard, or a design that matches your company's brand, the effort required to "skin" the admin is greater than the effort to just build a custom view.

## 2. When to Stop Using the Admin

| Sign it’s time to move | Why? |
| --- | --- |
| **User Roles** | If non-staff users (customers) need to enter data. |
| **Logic Overload** | If your `admin.py` is over 300 lines long. |
| **API Integration** | If the page needs to communicate heavily with JavaScript/AJAX. |
| **Multi-Object Forms** | If you need to edit 5 different models on one screen. |
| **Workflow State** | If you need a "Wizard" style step-by-step process. |

---

## 3. The "Custom View" Transition

When you reach these limits, you don't have to lose the benefits of the admin. You can build **Custom Views** and link them *into* the admin, or build a separate dashboard.

### Example: A Custom Dashboard View

Instead of forcing a complex reporting tool into the admin, you build a standard Django view:

```python
# views.py
@staff_member_required # Keeps it secure for only admins
def sales_report(request):
    data = calculate_complex_sales_stats()
    return render(request, 'admin/sales_report.html', {'data': data})

```

And then link to it from the admin sidebar using a custom template.

## 4. Summary: The Rule of Thumb

* **Use the Admin** for "Internal CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It is perfect for you, your developers, and your trusted staff to manage the raw database.
* **Build Custom Views** for "Workflows." If someone is "onboarding a client" or "submitting a support ticket," they shouldn't be looking at a raw database table.
