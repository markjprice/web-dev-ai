> **Prompt**: Please explain Django template inheritance using a real multi-page website layout example.

Template inheritance is arguably the most powerful feature of the Django Template Language (DTL). It follows the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle, allowing you to build a "skeleton" for your site and then "plug in" unique content for each page.

---

## 1. The Base Skeleton (`base.html`)

Think of this as your site's master frame. It contains everything that stays the same across every page—the HTML boilerplate, the navigation bar, the CSS links, and the footer.

We use the `{% block %}` tag to mark out "holes" in the template that child pages will fill later.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>{% block title %}My Awesome Site{% endblock %}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <nav>
        <a href="/">Home</a> | <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>
    </nav>

    <main>
        {% block content %}
        {% endblock %}
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2026 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

```

## 2. The Child Page (`home.html`)

A child page is surprisingly empty. It doesn't need `<html>` or `<body>` tags because it "inherits" them. It only needs to define what goes inside the blocks.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Welcome Home{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Welcome to our Homepage!</h1>
    <p>This content is unique to the home page, but the Nav and Footer are pulled from the base.</p>
{% endblock %}

```

## 3. A Multi-Level Example (`blog_detail.html`)

In large projects, you often use **three-level inheritance**.

1. **Level 1:** `base.html` (The sitewide frame)
2. **Level 2:** `blog_base.html` (Adds a blog-specific sidebar to the base)
3. **Level 3:** `blog_detail.html` (The actual post content)

### Level 2: `blog_base.html`

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-main">
            {% block blog_content %}{% endblock %}
        </div>
        <div class="col-sidebar">
            <h3>Recent Posts</h3>
            </div>
    </div>
{% endblock %}

```

### Level 3: `blog_detail.html`

```html
{% extends "blog_base.html" %}

{% block blog_content %}
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.body }}</p>
{% endblock %}

```

## 4. Key Rules of Inheritance

* **The First Tag:** `{% extends %}` must be the very first tag in a child template. If you put anything before it, Django will ignore it or throw an error.
* **Unique Block Names:** Give your blocks descriptive names (`content`, `scripts`, `extra_css`). If you use the same block name twice in one file, only the second one will count.
* **`{{ block.super }}`:** If you want to *add* content to a block rather than completely overwriting it (like adding a specific JS file to the existing sitewide scripts), use `{{ block.super }}` inside the block.

## Summary Table

| Tag | Purpose | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`{% extends %}`** | Links a child to a parent. | Top of the child template. |
| **`{% block %}`** | Defines an overrideable section. | Both Parent (as a hole) and Child (as content). |
| **`{{ block.super }}`** | Keeps parent content and adds to it. | Inside a block in the child template. |
