> **Prompt**: What does the selector `a:hover` do?

In the world of web design, the `:hover` selector is what we call a **pseudo-class**. It’s used to select and style an element only when a user mouses over it.

When applied specifically to the `<a>` tag (an anchor or link), `a:hover` allows you to change the link's appearance the moment a cursor touches it, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.

### How it Works

By default, links are static. Using `a:hover` tells the browser: "When the mouse is over this link, temporarily override its normal styles with these new ones."

### A Common Example

Here is how you would use it in your CSS:

```css
/* The link in its normal state */
a {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* The link when you hover over it */
a:hover {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
  cursor: pointer;
}

```

### Key Rules to Remember

1. **Order Matters:** In your CSS file, `:hover` must come **after** `:link` and `:visited` to work correctly. (A common shorthand to remember the order is **L**o**V**e/**H**a**T**e: `link`, `visited`, `hover`, `active`).
2. **User Experience:** It’s most commonly used to change colors, add underlines, or trigger subtle animations to show that an item is clickable.
3. **Touch Screens:** Keep in mind that `:hover` doesn't really exist on mobile devices (since there is no "hovering" finger), so don't rely on it for essential information!
