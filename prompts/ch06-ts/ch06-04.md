> **Prompt**: How does TypeScript handle existing JavaScript files in a project? 

TypeScript is designed to be adopted gradually, which is why it’s often called a "superset" of JavaScript. It doesn't require an all-or-nothing migration; instead, it treats existing JavaScript files with a surprising amount of flexibility.

Here is how TypeScript interacts with your legacy `.js` files:

---

## 1. The "AllowJS" Strategy

By default, the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) ignores `.js` files. However, you can toggle a setting in your `tsconfig.json` called `allowJs: true`.

* **What happens:** TypeScript will include your JavaScript files in the compilation process. This allows you to import a function from an old `.js` file into a brand new `.ts` file without the compiler complaining that the module is missing.
* **The Benefit:** You can migrate your project file-by-file rather than rewriting everything at once.

## 2. Type Inference via JSDoc

Even if a file ends in `.js`, TypeScript will try to be helpful. It uses **Inference** to guess types based on how you use variables. If you want to give it more hints without converting the file to TypeScript, you can use **JSDoc** comments.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @returns {number}
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

```

TypeScript reads these comments and provides autocompletion and error checking as if the file were written in `.ts`.

## 3. The "CheckJS" Guard

If you want TypeScript to actually point out errors in your JavaScript files (like calling a function with the wrong number of arguments), you can enable `checkJs: true`.

* This turns on the "police" for your JavaScript files.
* If you have a specific JS file that is too messy to check, you can add `// @ts-nocheck` at the top of that file to tell TypeScript to look the other way.

## 4. Declaration Files (`.d.ts`)

Sometimes you have a large JavaScript library or a legacy file that you don't want to touch at all. You can create a **Declaration File**.

This is a file that contains only type information (no logic). It tells TypeScript: *"Hey, I have this JavaScript file over here. I promise it has a function called `getData` that returns a string."*

### Comparison of JS Handling Modes

| Setting | Effect | Best Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowJs: false` | Ignores `.js` files entirely. | Green-field projects with zero legacy code. |
| `allowJs: true` | Allows importing JS into TS. | Starting a gradual migration. |
| `checkJs: true` | Reports errors in `.js` files. | Cleaning up a legacy codebase without changing extensions. |
