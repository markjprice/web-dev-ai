> **Prompt**: Why do some developers use the term "transpile" about TypeScript?

Developers use the term “transpile” with TypeScript because of *what* the TypeScript compiler is doing and *what it is not doing*.

Traditionally, a compiler translates code from one language into a lower-level language, often with a very different execution model. For example, C to machine code. The output bears little resemblance to the input, and the runtime environment changes completely.

TypeScript does not work like that.

TypeScript translates TypeScript code into JavaScript. JavaScript is not a lower-level language in this context. It is the *same* language family and runs in the same environment. The structure of the code usually stays very similar. Types are removed, syntax may be slightly rewritten, but the overall logic is unchanged.

That is where “transpile” comes from. It is a blend of “translate” and “compile”, and it is commonly used when converting from one high-level language to another high-level language.

In the case of TypeScript, two things typically happen during this process.

First, TypeScript-specific syntax is removed. Types, interfaces, and type annotations do not exist at runtime, so they are stripped out entirely.

Second, modern JavaScript features may be rewritten into older JavaScript syntax, depending on the `target` setting. For example, `let` or `const` might become `var`, or newer language features might be expanded into equivalent older constructs so that older browsers can run the code.

Because the output is still JavaScript, and because the transformation is mostly structural rather than conceptual, many developers feel “compile” sounds misleading. “Transpile” better captures the idea that the code is being reshaped, not fundamentally lowered.

That said, the TypeScript team themselves use the word “compile” in their tooling and documentation. The command is `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler. Both terms are used in practice, often interchangeably.

A useful way to explain this to readers is:

* TypeScript *compiles* your code so tools can check it
* It *transpiles* your code so browsers can run it

The important takeaway is not the word choice. It is the mental model. TypeScript changes how you write code and how early errors appear, but it does not change what the browser ultimately runs.
