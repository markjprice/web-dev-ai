> **Prompt**: Please create a Python code file with a problem that needs debugging so that I can practice my debugging skills.

This is a great way to sharpen your mental compiler. I’ve put together a script that attempts to process the data from your `Media.sql` logic using Python.

There are **3 distinct bugs** hidden in this code: one is a **syntax error**, one is a **logical error**, and one is a **runtime error** related to how data types are handled.

### The Challenge: "The Media Processor"

```python
def calculate_average_length(episodes):
    """
    Takes a list of dictionaries and calculates the average runtime.
    Expected input: [{'name': 'Pilot', 'length': 23}, {'name': 'Darmok', 'length': 45}]
    """
    total_time = 0
    count = 0
    
    for ep in episodes:
        # BUG 1: Logic Error - How are we accessing the length?
        total_time += episodes['length']
        count += 1
        
    return total_time / count

def find_titles_by_year(titles_list, year):
    # BUG 2: Syntax Error - Something is missing in this function definition
    results = []
    for title in titles_list
        if title['release_year'] == year:
            results.append(title['name'])
    return results

def main():
    # Sample data reflecting your SQL schema
    my_titles = [
        {'name': 'Star Trek: TNG', 'kind': 'series', 'release_year': 1987},
        {'name': 'The Matrix', 'kind': 'film', 'release_year': 1999},
        {'name': 'The Office', 'kind': 'series', 'release_year': "2005"} # BUG 3: Data Type Issue
    ]
    
    episodes = [
        {'name': 'Encounter at Farpoint', 'length': 47},
        {'name': 'Darmok', 'length': 45}
    ]

    print(f"Titles from 1987: {find_titles_by_year(my_titles, 1987)}")
    
    avg = calculate_average_length(episodes)
    print(f"Average Episode Length: {avg} minutes")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

### How to Debug This

If you want to practice like a pro, try these steps:

1. **Dry Run:** Read the code line-by-line without running it. Can you spot the missing colon or the incorrect variable reference?
2. **The Stack Trace:** Run the code. Python will throw a `SyntaxError` first. Once you fix that, it will throw a `TypeError`.
3. **Print Debugging:** Add `print(type(title['release_year']))` inside the search function to see why the third movie might not be showing up if you searched for 2005.
