> **Prompt**: Please give a code example of animating a path so it looks like it’s being drawn using `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset`.

Here is a clean, minimal example that shows exactly how the “draw-on” effect works. Nothing fancy, just the core idea exposed so it makes sense rather than feeling like a trick.

The key idea, step by step, before the code:

1. You turn the path into a dashed line where the dash is as long as the entire path.
2. You shift that dash completely off the path using `stroke-dashoffset`.
3. You animate the offset back to zero, which makes the stroke appear to be drawn.

A simple SVG path draw animation

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>SVG Path Draw Animation</title>

    <style>
      svg {
        width: 300px;
        display: block;
        margin: 40px auto;
      }

      .draw-path {
        fill: none;
        stroke: #1f5fbf;
        stroke-width: 6;

        /* The magic */
        stroke-dasharray: 600;
        stroke-dashoffset: 600;

        animation: draw-line 2.5s ease-out forwards;
      }

      @keyframes draw-line {
        to {
          stroke-dashoffset: 0;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>

    <svg viewBox="0 0 300 120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <path
        class="draw-path"
        d="
          M 20 60
          C 60 10, 120 110, 170 60
          C 220 10, 280 110, 330 60
        "
      />
    </svg>

  </body>
</html>
```

### Why these numbers work

`stroke-dasharray: 600;`
This sets a single dash that’s longer than the path itself. The exact number does not have to be perfect. It just needs to be “long enough”.

`stroke-dashoffset: 600;`
This shifts the dash completely past the visible path, making it invisible.

When the animation runs, the dash slides back into place, revealing the stroke progressively from start to end.

If you want the animation to replay on hover

```css
svg:hover .draw-path {
  animation: draw-line 2.5s ease-out forwards;
}
```

You’ll usually also want to reset the offset:

```css
.draw-path {
  stroke-dasharray: 600;
  stroke-dashoffset: 600;
}

svg:hover .draw-path {
  animation: draw-line 2.5s ease-out forwards;
}
```

### Making the timing feel better

You can change the personality of the animation just by adjusting easing and duration.

```css
animation: draw-line 1.8s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) forwards;
```

This gives a more “UI-like” motion curve.

### Common beginner mistakes (worth calling out explicitly)

* Forgetting `fill: none`, which causes strange fills to appear.
* Using a dash length that’s shorter than the path, which results in repeated dashes instead of a draw effect.
* Animating `stroke-dasharray` instead of `stroke-dashoffset`. You almost never want to do that.

### Strong mental model to remember

Think of the stroke as a long strip of paint wrapped around the path.
`stroke-dasharray` defines the strip.
`stroke-dashoffset` slides it along the path.

Once that clicks, this technique stops feeling magical and starts feeling obvious, which is exactly where you want to end up.
