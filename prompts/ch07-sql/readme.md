**Prompts for *Chapter 7 SQL* with links to responses**

- [What trade-offs do relational databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL make compared to document databases like MongoDB?](ch07-01.md)
- [How closely do modern databases actually follow the ISO SQL standard? Explain why SQL dialects diverged and why full portability is difficult in practice.](ch07-02.md)
- [I have been told that SQL has no loops, no if-statements in the way Python or JavaScript does, and no concept of step-by-step control flow. But I've seen that T-SQL does have those keywords. Why? Do all SQL dialects actually have flow control statements?](ch07-03.md)
- [How does the database engine actually execute a JOIN under the hood?](ch07-04.md)
- [Why do relational databases treat tables as unordered sets, and what problems arise if developers assume row order?](ch07-05.md)
- [How do you safely change a database schema once real data exists? Please explain migrations and why they exist even when `ALTER TABLE` is available. Please include examples of schema design mistakes that are painful to fix later.](ch07-06.md)
- [Please explain normalization vs denormalization with a realistic example and show when denormalization is justified.](ch07-07.md)
- [How do foreign key constraints affect refactoring and data cleanup?](ch07-08.md)
- [Please show me some common bugs caused by misunderstanding NULL and how to avoid them.](ch07-09.md)
- [Please create a Mermaid Entity-Relationship diagram for this database based on the attached SQL script.](ch07-10.md)
- [Please show me some examples where moving a condition from WHERE to ON changes the meaning of a LEFT JOIN.](ch07-11.md)
- [Please explain `JOIN`s visually using Venn diagrams and explain where those diagrams break down.](ch07-12.md)
- [Please show me some examples of queries that look correct but silently drop rows because of JOIN choices.](ch07-13.md)
- [Please explain why `COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(column)` produce different results with examples.](ch07-14.md)
- [Please compare `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`, and `CASE` with real-world use cases.](ch07-15.md)
- [Why does NULL behave differently from other values in comparisons and aggregates?](ch07-16.md)
- [Please show me some examples where `HAVING` is required and `WHERE` cannot be used.](ch07-17.md)
- [Please explain relational algebra in simple terms and show how `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `GROUP BY` map to it.](ch07-18.md)
- [How do SQLite and PostgreSQL differ in transaction and locking behavior?](ch07-19.md)
- [Please explain the ACID properties in detail for a beginner with code examples using real-world failures like power loss or server crashes.](ch07-20.md)
- [What is isolation level, and why does it matter even for simple applications? Please explain lost updates, dirty reads, and phantom reads with simple examples.](ch07-21.md)
- [What is a B-tree and why is it important in databases?](ch07-22.md)
- [Please explain how a database chooses between a table scan and an index scan.](ch07-23.md)
- [Please show me some examples where adding an index makes a query slower, not faster.](ch07-24.md)
- [Please explain index selectivity and why indexing Boolean columns is often useless.](ch07-25.md)
- [Please compare single-column and composite indexes with realistic query patterns.](ch07-26.md)
- [Please explain why `ORDER BY` can sometimes be satisfied by an index and sometimes cannot.](ch07-27.md)
- [Please explain `EXPLAIN` vs `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and how to read the output.](ch07-28.md)
- [Please show me how to debug a slow SQL query step by step.](ch07-29.md)
