> **Prompt**: Please explain relational algebra in simple terms and show how `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `GROUP BY` map to it.

Think of **Relational Algebra** as the "math under the hood" of SQL. When you write a query, the database doesn't just read your words; it translates them into a series of mathematical operations to find the most efficient way to get your data.

In this math, a **Relation** is just a Table, and a **Tuple** is just a Row.

## 1. Selection () ➔ `WHERE`

In math, this is called **Selection**. It acts like a horizontal filter. It picks specific rows based on a condition.

* **Algebra:** 
* **SQL:** `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price > 100;`

## 2. Projection () ➔ `SELECT`

In math, this is called **Projection**. It acts like a vertical filter. It picks which columns you want to keep and discards the rest.

* **Algebra:** 
* **SQL:** `SELECT name, price FROM Products;`

> **Note:** In Relational Algebra,  automatically removes duplicate rows (because it treats the result as a set). In SQL, you have to explicitly use `SELECT DISTINCT` to get the same mathematical behavior.

## 3. Cartesian Product () and Join () ➔ `JOIN`

The **Join** is the "superpower" of relational algebra. It combines two tables based on a shared value.

* **The Cartesian Product ():** This matches every row of Table A with every row of Table B.
* **The Natural Join ():** This is the mathematical equivalent of an `INNER JOIN`. It finds the overlap where columns match.
* **Algebra:** 
* **SQL:** `SELECT * FROM Users JOIN Orders ON Users.id = Orders.user_id;`

## 4. Aggregate Functions () ➔ `GROUP BY`

Relational algebra uses the "script G" () to represent grouping and calculations.

* **Algebra:** 
* **SQL:** `SELECT dept_id, COUNT(emp_id) FROM Employees GROUP BY dept_id;`

The values on the left of the  are the columns you are grouping by, and the values on the right are the math you are performing (Sum, Count, Avg).

## Why does this matter?

The database engine uses these symbols to create a **Query Plan**. Because of the laws of math, the engine knows it can swap the order of operations to make things faster.

For example, the engine knows that:


**In plain English:** It is almost always faster to filter out the rows you don't need (`WHERE`) **before** you bother picking specific columns (`SELECT`) or joining to another table. This is called "Predicate Pushdown."
