> **Prompt**: Please show me a table of HTML versions and when they were introduced. Then describe HTML5 and show me a table of new tags that it introduced and what they should be used for.

HTML has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 1990s. While early versions were quite limited, the language has grown to support complex multimedia and interactive applications.

# HTML Version History

# What is HTML5?

**HTML5** was a major turning point for the web. Before HTML5, if you wanted to play a video or show an animation, you often had to use third-party plugins like Adobe Flash.

The goal of HTML5 was to make the web more capable and "semantic." **Semantic HTML** means using tags that describe the *meaning* of the content, rather than just how it looks. This makes websites much more accessible for screen readers (used by people with visual impairments) and easier for search engines to index.

# New Semantic Tags in HTML5

These tags were introduced to replace generic `<div>` containers with specific names that describe their purpose.

| Tag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<header>` | Defines a container for introductory content or navigation links. |
| `<nav>` | Used specifically for a set of navigation links (menus). |
| `<main>` | Specifies the unique, primary content of the document. |
| `<section>` | Groups related content together (like a "Chapter" or "About" section). |
| `<article>` | For self-contained content that could stand alone (like a blog post). |
| `<aside>` | For content indirectly related to the main text (like a sidebar). |
| `<footer>` | Defines a footer for a document or section, usually containing copyright info. |
| `<video>` | Embeds video content directly without needing extra plugins. |
| `<audio>` | Embeds sound or music streams natively in the browser. |
| `<canvas>` | Used to draw graphics or animations on the fly via JavaScript. |

# Why use these?

Using a `<nav>` tag instead of a `<div>` tells the browser, "This is the menu." This allows mobile devices to handle navigation better and helps Google understand the structure of your page more clearly.
