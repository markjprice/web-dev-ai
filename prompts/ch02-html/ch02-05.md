> **Prompt**: Please quiz me about the new tags introduced with HTML5. Focus mainly on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing exact syntax.

Instead of asking you to write code, I’ve put together a **"Scenario-Based Quiz."** Imagine you are building a website for a **Local News Station**. For each scenario below, choose which HTML5 tag is the most "semantically correct" choice.

---

### Question 1: The News Article

You have a story about a local parade. This story has its own title, author, and text. It should be able to stand alone if someone shared it on another website.

* **A)** `<section>`
* **B)** `<article>`
* **C)** `<div>`

### Question 2: The Side Note

Next to the parade story, you want to put a small box that shows the "Weather Forecast" for the day of the parade. It’s related to the page but isn't part of the main story.

* **A)** `<aside>`
* **B)** `<nav>`
* **C)** `<footer>`

### Question 3: The Main Event

You are wrapping the entire parade story, the weather box, and the comments section. This is the **primary, unique content** of this specific page (not including the site-wide menu or the logo).

* **A)** `<body>`
* **B)** `<main>`
* **C)** `<header>`

### Question 4: The Navigation

You have a list of links at the top of the page: *Home, Local News, Sports, and Contact*. Which tag tells a screen reader, "This is the menu"?

* **A)** `<menu>`
* **B)** `<list>`
* **C)** `<nav>`

### Question 5: The Photo Caption

You include a photo of the parade. You want to group the image and the text describing who is in the photo together as one unit.

* **A)** `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
* **B)** `<section>` and `<p>`
* **C)** `<div>` and `<span>`

### The Big Conceptual Bonus

**Why does it even matter?** If the page *looks* the same to a human user whether you use a `<div>` or a `<header>`, what is the primary benefit of using the semantic HTML5 tags? (Pick the best answer)

* **A)** It makes the website load 50% faster.
* **B)** It helps search engines (SEO) and people using screen readers (Accessibility) understand the "map" of your content.
* **C)** Browsers will crash if you use too many `<div>` tags.

This video is a great visual companion because it breaks down the specific differences between the "Section" and "Article" tags, which is often the most confusing part of the HTML5 update.
