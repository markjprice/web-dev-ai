> **Prompt**: What does chmod +x actually change at the operating system level?

When you run `chmod +x filename`, you aren't just changing a setting in a configuration file; you are modifying a specific piece of **metadata** stored in the file system’s **inode**.

To understand this at the OS level, we have to look at how Linux/Unix views every single file as a collection of binary "bits."

---

## 1. The Permission Bitmask

Every file on your disk has a set of "mode bits" (permissions). These are typically stored in blocks of 9 bits, divided into three categories: **User** (owner), **Group**, and **Others**.

For each category, there are three possible actions:

1. **Read (r)**: Bit value 4
2. **Write (w)**: Bit value 2
3. **Execute (x)**: Bit value 1

When you run `+x`, you are telling the OS to flip the **Execute** bit from a `0` (Off) to a `1` (On) for all three categories.

## 2. What the Kernel Sees

When you try to run a file (e.g., `./script.sh`), the **Kernel** performs a "permission check" before it even looks at the contents of the file.

* **If the Execute bit is 0:** The Kernel immediately rejects the request with `Permission denied`. It doesn't care if the file contains a valid program or just a grocery list.
* **If the Execute bit is 1:** The Kernel proceeds to load the file into memory. It then looks at the **Shebang** (as we discussed) or the binary header to figure out how to run it.

---

## 3. The Directory vs. File Difference

The "Execute" bit actually means two different things depending on what you are pointing at:

* **For a File:** It means the file can be run as a program or script.
* **For a Directory:** It means the directory can be **entered** (passed through). If a directory has `r` (read) but not `x` (execute), you can see the names of the files inside it, but you cannot `cd` into it or access the actual data within those files.

---

## 4. Viewing the Change

You can see these bits in action using the `ls -l` command. Watch the string of characters on the left:

| State | `ls -l` output | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Before `+x**` | `-rw-r--r--` | Read/Write for owner; Read only for others. |
| **After `+x**` | `-rwxr-xr-x` | **Execute** bits are now active (the `x` appears). |

---

## 5. Why is this a security feature?

In Windows, any file ending in `.exe` is considered executable. In Unix-like systems, the **extension doesn't matter**. A file named `virus.exe` is harmless in Linux unless someone (or some process) explicitly sets that **Execute bit**.

By default, files created by users or downloaded from the web do *not* have the execute bit set. This "Secure by Default" approach prevents accidental execution of malicious code.

### Pro-Tip: Numeric Mode

Instead of `+x`, you will often see experienced developers use numbers:
`chmod 755 script.sh`

* **7** (4+2+1): Owner can Read, Write, and Execute.
* **5** (4+0+1): Group can Read and Execute.
* **5** (4+0+1): Others can Read and Execute.
