> **Prompt**: What are common beginner mistakes in Bash scripts, and how can I spot them?

Writing Bash scripts can feel like navigating a minefield because the syntax is notoriously unforgiving. Most beginner mistakes stem from the fact that Bash treats **spaces**, **quotes**, and **variables** differently than languages like Python or JavaScript.

Here are the most common "gotchas" and how to identify them before they break your system.

---

## 1. The Space Sensitive Syntax

In most languages, `x = 5` and `x=5` are the same. In Bash, they are completely different.

* **The Mistake:** `VAR = "Hello"`
* **What happens:** Bash thinks `VAR` is a command and `=` and `"Hello"` are its arguments. It will throw a `command not found` error.
* **The Fix:** Never put spaces around the equals sign when assigning variables: `VAR="Hello"`.

Similarly, in `if` statements:

* **Wrong:** `if[$name=="Alex"]`
* **Right:** `if [ "$name" == "Alex" ]` (The `[` is actually a command, and it requires spaces to separate its arguments).

---

## 2. Forgetting to Quote Variables

This is the single most common cause of bugs in Bash.

* **The Mistake:** `rm $FILENAME`
* **The Danger:** If `$FILENAME` is `"My Photos"`, Bash interprets the command as `rm My Photos`. It will try to delete a file named `My` and a file named `Photos` separately.
* **The Fix:** **Always** wrap your variables in double quotes: `rm "$FILENAME"`.

---

## 3. Using the Wrong Type of Quotes

Bash has three types of "wrappers," and they all do different things:

* **Double Quotes (`" "`)**: Interpret symbols. `echo "Hi $USER"` prints `Hi Alex`.
* **Single Quotes (`' '`)**: Literal text. `echo 'Hi $USER'` prints `Hi $USER` exactly as written.
* **Backticks (`` ``) or `$()**`: Command substitution. These run a command and put the output into a variable.
* *Tip:* Always use `$(command)` instead of backticks; it's easier to read and allows you to nest commands inside each other.



---

## 4. Failing to Handle Errors

As we discussed, Bash keeps going even if a command fails.

* **The Mistake:** Not checking if a directory exists before moving into it.
* **The Spot:** If you see a script that uses `cd` without an `&&` or `set -e`, it’s a red flag.
* **The Fix:** Use `cd folder || exit` or start your script with `set -e`.

## 5. How to Spot These Mistakes Automatically

You don't have to find these by eye. There is a "spell-checker" for Bash called **ShellCheck**.

### The "Pro" Way: ShellCheck

1. **Online:** Paste your code into [shellcheck.net](https://www.shellcheck.net/).
2. **Command Line:** Install it (`sudo apt install shellcheck`) and run `shellcheck myscript.sh`.
3. **VS Code:** Install the ShellCheck extension to see "squiggly" lines under errors as you type.

## Summary Checklist

Before you run any script, ask yourself:

1. Did I use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`?
2. Are there spaces around my `=` signs? (There shouldn't be).
3. Are all my file path variables wrapped in `"quotes"`?
4. Did I include `set -euo pipefail` at the top?
