> **Prompt**: Please explain relative vs absolute paths in Bash using a directory tree example.

In Bash, a **path** is simply the address of a file or folder. Understanding the difference between **Absolute** and **Relative** paths is the difference between giving someone GPS coordinates versus saying, "it’s the third door on the left."

## The Directory Tree

Let's use this structure as our map. Imagine your current location (the "State" of your shell) is inside the `scripts` folder.

```text
/ (Root)
├── bin
├── home
│   └── user
│       ├── photos
│       │   └── vacation.jpg
│       └── dev
│           └── scripts  <-- YOU ARE HERE
└── tmp

```

## 1. Absolute Paths (The GPS Coordinates)

An absolute path is the **complete address** from the very top of the computer (the Root, represented by `/`). It doesn't matter where you are currently standing; an absolute path always works.

* **Key Characteristic:** Always starts with a forward slash `/`.
* **Example:** To get to `vacation.jpg` from anywhere:
`ls /home/user/photos/vacation.jpg`

> **Analogy:** "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C." No matter what city you are in, that address points to exactly one place.

---

## 2. Relative Paths (The Directions)

A relative path is the address **relative to your current location**. It is shorter to type, but it only works if you are in the right spot.

* **Key Characteristic:** Does *not* start with a `/`. It often uses symbols like `.` (here) or `..` (up one level).
* **Example:** Since you are in `scripts`, to get to `vacation.jpg`, you have to go up two levels and then down into photos:
`ls ../../photos/vacation.jpg`

> **Analogy:** "Go out the door, turn left, and it's the second house." These directions only work if you are starting from the specific room you're in now.

## Path Symbols Cheat Sheet

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`/`** | The Root (The very top) | `cd /etc` |
| **`~`** | Your Home folder | `cd ~/Documents` |
| **`.`** | The Current folder | `./my_script.sh` |
| **`..`** | The Parent folder (Up one) | `cd ..` |

## Which one should you use?

### Use Absolute Paths in **Scripts**:

If you write a script to back up a folder, use `/home/user/data`. If you use a relative path and run the script from the wrong folder, it might back up the wrong thing (or nothing at all).

### Use Relative Paths for **Daily Typing**:

If you are already deep inside a project folder, typing `cd ../css` is much faster than typing the full `/home/user/dev/project/assets/css`.

In Bash, the **`$PATH`** variable is one of the most important parts of your environment's "state." It is the reason you can type `ls` instead of typing the absolute path `/bin/ls` every single time.

---

## 1. What is the $PATH?

The `$PATH` is an **environment variable** that contains a colon-separated list of directories. When you type a command, Bash looks through these directories, one by one, from left to right, searching for an executable file with that name.

If you type `echo $PATH`, you will see something like this:
`/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`

---

## 2. The Search Process (Step-by-Step)

Imagine you type the command `python`. Here is what Bash does:

1. **Check Aliases:** Is `python` an alias? (No).
2. **Check Built-ins:** Is `python` a built-in shell command like `cd`? (No).
3. **The PATH Hunt:**
* Does `/usr/local/bin/python` exist? (No).
* Does `/usr/bin/python` exist? **Yes!**


4. **Execution:** Bash stops searching and runs that specific file.

> **Note:** If Bash reaches the end of the list and finds nothing, it returns the famous: `command not found`.

---

## 3. Why this matters: Absolute vs. Relative

The `$PATH` is almost always made of **Absolute Paths**. This is a security feature.

If your `$PATH` included a relative path like `.` (the current directory), a hacker could put a malicious file named `ls` in a folder. If you `cd` into that folder and type `ls`, the shell might run the malicious script instead of the real system command!

### Adding to your PATH

When you install new software (like Node.js or Flutter), you often have to "add it to your PATH." You do this in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` like this:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/home/user/my_new_tools"

```

* **`$PATH`**: This includes the *existing* list so you don't overwrite it.
* **`:/home/user/my_new_tools`**: This appends your new absolute path to the end of the list.

---

## 4. How to find where a command lives

If you ever wonder which folder a command is actually running from, you can use the `which` or `type` commands:

* **`which ls`** → Outputs: `/bin/ls`
* **`type -a python`** → Shows every location in your PATH where a "python" executable exists.

---

### Pro-Tip: Command Precedence

If you have two versions of a program installed (e.g., an old version in `/usr/bin` and a new one in `/usr/local/bin`), the one in the directory that appears **earlier** in your `$PATH` string will be the one that runs.
